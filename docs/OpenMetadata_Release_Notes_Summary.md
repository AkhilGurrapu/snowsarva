# OpenMetadata Releases â€“ Analysis for SnowSarva

Source: [Release 1.6.0-rc1](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/releases/tag/1.6.0-rc1-release), [Release 1.5.0-rc1](https://github.com/open-metadata/OpenMetadata/releases/tag/1.5.0-rc1-release)

This document summarises key features and architectural patterns from recent OpenMetadata releases. These insights serve as a blueprint and source of inspiration for SnowSarva's development, particularly for its lineage, data quality, and governance components.

## 1. Key Themes & Feature Breakdown

### a) Column-Level Lineage & SQL Intelligence
* **Sigma Column-Level Lineage** (`#18571`): OpenMetadata can now parse Sigma workbooks to generate detailed, column-level lineage, linking BI dashboards back to source tables.
* **SQL Masking in Lineage** (`#18565`): A critical security feature that masks sensitive values within SQL queries used for lineage and usage analysis, preventing data leakage into metadata.
* **Lineage Failure Tracing** (`#18580`): The lineage graph can now be annotated with data quality test outcomes, allowing users to see exactly where a data quality failure breaks a downstream pipeline.
* **Lineage Propagation Config** (`#18486`): Finer control over how lineage is computed and stitched together across complex views and transformations.

### b) Expanded Connector & Integration Ecosystem
* **New Connectors**: Support was added for **Azure Data Factory** (`#18543`), **Stitch** (`#18452`), **Qlik Cloud**, and **MicroStrategy** (`#18555`), demonstrating a broad and extensible metadata ingestion framework.
* **dbt Enhancements**: dbt integration now includes support for Tiers & Glossaries, allowing richer metadata to be pulled from dbt projects.

### c) Advanced Data Quality & Profiling
* **Data Diff with Sampling** (`#18532`): The "Data Diff" feature, which compares two tables, can now operate on a configurable sample, making it viable for very large datasets.
* **Multi-Metric Support for Data Insights** (`#18476`): The Data Insights module, used for platform analytics, can now compute and display multiple, user-defined metrics.
* **Workflow Classification & Metric-Level Config** (`#18572`): Data quality tests can be grouped into "classifications" (e.g., "PII Checks", "Accuracy Checks"), and individual metrics can have their own configuration.

### d) Enterprise Security & Deployment
* **SAML Deployment Docs** (`#16822`): Official documentation for setting up SAML-based single sign-on.
* **JWT Troubleshooting Guide** (`#18602`): Enhanced documentation for diagnosing issues with JSON Web Token authentication.
* **Kubernetes Deployment Guide** (`#16872`): Updated and improved guides for deploying OpenMetadata on Kubernetes.

## 2. Architectural Implications for SnowSarva

The features in OpenMetadata provide a mature roadmap for SnowSarva's core functionality.

*   **For the `Metadata Catalog & Lineage Tracker`:**
    *   **Goal**: Implement a robust SQL parser (within a Snowpark Container) that can generate column-level lineage from `QUERY_HISTORY`, similar to OpenMetadata's Sigma and dbt parsers.
    *   **Action**: Prioritise a security feature to mask PII/sensitive data found in SQL text *before* persisting it to the lineage graph, mirroring OM's SQL masking (`#18565`).
    *   **Action**: Design the lineage data model to store data quality outcomes alongside table/column nodes, enabling failure tracing (`#18580`).

*   **For the `Data Quality Assurance & Remediation` Module:**
    *   **Goal**: The "Data Diff" concept should be a core feature, allowing users to compare table schemas and data distributions, leveraging Snowflake's `TABLE_SAMPLE()` for efficiency.
    *   **Action**: Build a flexible rule engine that allows users to define custom quality metrics and group them into "classification workflows" (`#18572`).

*   **For the `Governance & Access-Control Auditor`:**
    *   **Goal**: While SnowSarva will use Snowflake's native authentication, the detailed SAML/JWT documentation from OpenMetadata highlights the need for robust troubleshooting and configuration guides for enterprise customers.
    *   **Action**: Plan to include a "Security Health Check" dashboard that validates user roles, permissions, and other security configurations.

*   **For the `API & Interface Layer`:**
    *   **Goal**: Develop a clean, well-documented REST API. OpenMetadata's separation of sync (`export`) and async (`exportAsync`) APIs is a good pattern for long-running metadata export jobs.
    *   **Action**: Ensure the API supports hierarchical search and robust pagination from day one (`#18567`, `#18578`).

By studying and adapting these patterns, SnowSarva can accelerate its development and deliver a powerful, enterprise-ready data observability and management experience natively within Snowflake.
