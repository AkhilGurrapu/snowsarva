### Architectural Plan for a Data Monitoring and Management SaaS App

Here is a detailed architectural plan for building a scalable, multi-tenant SaaS application for data monitoring and management, with a specific focus on providing granular, column-level data lineage.

#### 1. Core Architectural Principles

The application will be designed as a cloud-native, multi-tenant platform. Key architectural drivers include:
*   **Microservices Architecture**: The system will be decomposed into small, independent services to promote modularity, scalability, and easier maintenance[9].
*   **Multi-Tenancy**: The foundation of the SaaS model, allowing a single application instance to serve multiple customers (tenants) while ensuring their data is isolated and secure[9][10].
*   **Asynchronous Communication**: An event-driven approach using a message queue will be used for communication between services, enhancing scalability and resilience[11].
*   **Automation**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD pipelines will be used to automate deployment and scaling processes, ensuring consistency and reducing errors[9].

#### 2. System Architecture Layers

The architecture is divided into four primary layers:

| Layer | Description | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend (Presentation Layer)** | Provides an intuitive and responsive user interface for dashboards, data catalog browsing, lineage visualization, and system configuration[12]. | React, Vue.js, or Angular; Visualization libraries like D3.js or Visx for lineage graphs. |
| **Backend (Application Layer)** | The core of the application, composed of microservices that handle business logic, data processing, and APIs[12]. | Python, Go, or Java; Docker for containerization; Kubernetes for orchestration. |
| **Data Collection Layer** | Agents or connectors that integrate with customer data sources to pull metadata, query logs, and usage statistics without accessing the underlying raw data. | Lightweight agents built in Python or Go, deployed in the customer's environment. |
| **Data & Storage Layer** | Manages the storage of tenant configuration, collected metadata, lineage graphs, and application logs[12]. | PostgreSQL, Object Storage (S3), Graph Database (Neo4j), and a Message Queue (Kafka/Redpanda). |

#### 3. Key Backend Microservices

The backend will consist of several specialized microservices communicating via a central message queue and REST APIs managed by an API Gateway.

*   **Metadata Collector**: Connects to customer data warehouses (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery) and BI tools to fetch metadata. It parses query logs, schemas, and dbt artifacts to collect the raw information needed for lineage and monitoring[3].
*   **Data Monitoring & Analysis Engine**: Consumes metadata to perform data quality checks. It monitors key metrics such as data freshness, volume changes, schema drifts, and data quality metrics like NULL percentages[5]. This service can leverage Python with libraries like Pandas for analysis.
*   **Column-Level Lineage Engine**: The core component for the lineage feature. It parses SQL queries to map dependencies between columns across tables and systems[13]. The resulting relationships are stored in a graph database.
*   **Alerting Service**: Triggers and sends notifications via channels like Slack, PagerDuty, or email when the analysis engine detects anomalies or data quality issues.
*   **Scheduler**: Manages and schedules jobs for the Metadata Collector and Analysis Engine to run at regular intervals.
*   **API & Authentication Service**: Provides a public API for programmatic access and handles user authentication, authorization, and tenant management.

#### 4. Implementing Column-Level Lineage

Achieving detailed column-level lineage is a complex but critical feature that provides visibility into how data transforms across the data stack[14][13].

1.  **Ingestion**: The Metadata Collector service ingests SQL query logs from data warehouses, along with metadata from dbt and BI tools[3].
2.  **Parsing**: A robust SQL parser analyzes each query to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This allows the engine to understand the operations performed, including sources and targets.
3.  **Dependency Mapping**: The engine traverses the AST to identify relationships between columns. For example, in `CREATE TABLE new_table AS SELECT col_a AS col_b FROM old_table`, it maps a dependency from `old_table.col_a` to `new_table.col_b`.
4.  **Graph Storage**: The identified dependencies are modeled as a directed graph, where nodes represent columns and edges represent transformations. This graph is stored in a dedicated graph database like Neo4j for efficient querying of complex relationships.
5.  **Visualization**: The frontend queries the lineage API (which in turn queries the graph database) to fetch lineage data and renders it as an interactive, explorable graph[15].

#### 5. Monitoring and Scalability

To ensure reliability and performance, the platform itself must be monitored.

*   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Tools like **Datadog** or **New Relic** will be integrated to provide real-time insights into system performance, error rates, and resource utilization across all microservices[9].
*   **Scalability**: The use of Kubernetes enables auto-scaling, allowing the application to dynamically adjust compute resources based on tenant demand and processing load[16]. This is particularly important for the data processing and analysis services, which may experience variable workloads.
