# Data Management and Observability with Native Apps

This document outlines architectural patterns and strategies for building a sophisticated Data Management and Observability solution as a Snowflake Native App. The goal is to leverage the Native App framework to provide insights into data quality, usage, and lineage directly within a consumer's Snowflake account.

## 1. Core Concept: An Observability App

A Snowflake Native App for observability brings the analysis and monitoring logic to the consumer's data, rather than moving the data out. This provides a secure, integrated, and powerful way to deliver insights.

The ideal application would:
- **Scan** metadata and objects within the consumer's account (with their permission).
- **Analyze** query history, access logs, and data profiles.
- **Visualize** lineage, detect anomalies, and report on data quality.
- **Leverage** open-source standards and tools where possible.

## 2. Architectural Patterns

Building a comprehensive observability app involves combining several features of the Snowflake platform.

### Pattern 1: Metadata Analysis with Snowpark and Streamlit

This is the foundational pattern for most observability tasks.

-   **Logic (Snowpark)**: The core of the application is a set of Snowpark procedures (in Python or Java/Scala) that are granted specific privileges by the consumer. These procedures can read from the `SNOWFLAKE` shared database to access:
    -   `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY`: To analyze query patterns and build lineage.
    -   `ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY`: To track which users and roles access which tables and columns.
    -   `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`: To get a catalog of all databases, schemas, tables, and columns.
-   **Execution**: These procedures can be run on a schedule using Snowflake Tasks or triggered manually from the UI.
-   **UI (Streamlit)**: A Streamlit dashboard serves as the user interface. It allows consumers to trigger scans, view dashboards of data health, explore a graph of table/column lineage, and configure alerts.

### Pattern 2: AI-Powered Insights with Snowflake Cortex

For more advanced analysis, Snowflake Cortex functions can be integrated directly into the Snowpark logic.

-   **Use Case: PII Detection**: Use `SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE` with a prompt engineered to classify column names and sample data to automatically flag potential Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
-   **Use Case: Summarizing Complex Queries**: Use `COMPLETE` to translate complex SQL from `QUERY_HISTORY` into a natural language summary, making it easier to understand a table's purpose.
-   **Use Case: Anomaly Detection**: Use Cortex Anomaly Detection functions on time-series metadata (e.g., table row counts, query execution times) to automatically flag unusual events.

The `sfguide-build-contracts-chatbot` example from the `emerging-solutions-toolbox` demonstrates a powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern. A similar approach could be used to build a "data catalog chatbot" where consumers can ask questions like, "Which tables contain customer email addresses?" or "What was the most queried table last week?".

### Pattern 3: Integrating Open-Source Tools with Container Services

Many powerful open-source data tools (like data validators, lineage collectors, etc.) are distributed as container images. Snowflake Container Services (SPCS) allows you to run these tools directly inside the Native App.

-   **Use Case: OpenLineage Integration**:
    1.  Package the [OpenLineage client library](https://openlineage.io/docs/clients/python/) into a custom container image.
    2.  Create a job service that runs this container. The job would connect to the consumer's Snowflake account (from within the app), parse the `QUERY_HISTORY`, and generate OpenLineage-compliant events.
    3.  These events could be stored in a table for visualization or sent to an external OpenLineage-compatible metadata server via External Access.
-   **Use Case: Data Quality Validation with Great Expectations or dbt**:
    1.  Package a tool like [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) or the [dbt CLI](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/core/what-is-dbt) as a container service.
    2.  The Streamlit UI would allow consumers to define data quality rules (expectations) for their tables.
    3.  A job service would then execute the container, running the validation tool against the consumer's data and writing the results to a report table.

This pattern allows you to leverage the rich ecosystem of existing open-source tools without requiring the consumer to set up and manage them separately. The Native App handles the orchestration.

## 3. Putting It All Together: A Sample Architecture

A best-in-class Observability Native App would combine all three patterns:

1.  **A Streamlit UI** serves as the control panel for the consumer.
2.  **Core metadata scanning** and lineage parsing is handled by **Snowpark** procedures running on a schedule.
3.  **Cortex AI functions** are used to automatically classify data, detect anomalies, and provide a natural language interface to the data catalog.
4.  **Container Services** are used to run specialized, open-source tools for data validation (Great Expectations) and to generate standardized lineage events (OpenLineage).
5.  All results are written to tables within the application's secure schema, and the Streamlit UI reads from these tables to present the findings to the consumer.
