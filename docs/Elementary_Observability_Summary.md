# Elementary – Data Observability Reference

Source: <https://github.com/elementary-data/elementary>

Elementary is an open-source data observability platform, designed to work seamlessly with dbt (data build tool). It provides automated monitoring and alerting for data warehouses, helping data teams detect and resolve data quality issues before they impact downstream consumers.

## 1. Core Features & Architecture

Elementary's architecture revolves around extending the dbt workflow:

*   **dbt Package**: Elementary provides a dbt package (`elementary`) that adds custom tests and macros to a dbt project.
*   **dbt Test Results as Data**: It overrides the default dbt test behavior to store the results of every test run—including failures and warnings—as structured data in the warehouse. This historical log is the foundation for all its observability features.
*   **CLI Tool**: A Python-based CLI (`edr`) is used to generate a user-friendly HTML report and send Slack notifications based on the collected test results.

### Key Capabilities:
*   **Automated Data Profiling**: Generates statistics and metrics for tables, such as row counts, freshness, and schema structures.
*   **Anomaly Detection**: Automatically monitors key metrics (e.g., freshness, volume, column-level metrics) and flags unexpected changes or outliers. This goes beyond simple dbt tests.
*   **Enhanced dbt Tests**: Stores historical results of all dbt tests, allowing for trend analysis and easier debugging. It can also run tests on table row counts or freshness out-of-the-box.
*   **Data Lineage Integration**: Visualizes the dbt lineage graph and overlays it with test status, quickly showing the root cause and downstream impact of data quality failures.
*   **Alerting & Reporting**: Generates a detailed, self-contained HTML report with test results, model performance, and lineage graphs. It also sends concise, actionable alerts to Slack.

## 2. Architectural Implications for SnowSarva

Elementary's approach offers a powerful blueprint for SnowSarva's **Data Quality Assurance & Remediation** and **Metadata Catalog & Lineage Tracker** modules.

*   **For the `Data Quality Assurance` Module:**
    *   **Goal**: Instead of just running data quality checks, SnowSarva must *persist the results over time*. A dedicated table, `SNOWSARVA_APP.MONITORING.DATA_QUALITY_HISTORY`, should be created to store the outcome of every check, its parameters, and the number of failing rows.
    *   **Action**: Develop anomaly detection models (using `SNOWFLAKE.ML.ANOMALY_DETECTION`) that run on the historical quality metrics stored in the new table. This allows SnowSarva to detect "unknown unknowns."
    *   **Action**: Implement a notification service that can push rich, contextual alerts to Slack, similar to Elementary's reports. The alert should include not just the failure, but also a link to the lineage graph and historical pass/fail rates.

*   **For the `Metadata Catalog & Lineage Tracker`:**
    *   **Goal**: The lineage graph in SnowSarva should not just show dependencies; it must be an interactive diagnostic tool.
    *   **Action**: Design the UI to overlay data quality status (passing, failing, anomaly detected) directly onto the tables and views in the lineage graph. This provides immediate visual context for any data incident.

*   **For the `ETL/ELT Automation` Module:**
    *   **Goal**: Leverage dbt's metadata to the fullest extent.
    *   **Action**: Create a Snowpark task that regularly parses the `manifest.json` and `run_results.json` files from a customer's dbt runs (stored in a Stage). This data can be used to enrich the lineage graph and data quality history without requiring custom instrumentation.

By adopting these patterns from Elementary, SnowSarva can provide a deeply integrated and highly automated data observability experience that feels native to dbt users, a key persona for the application.
