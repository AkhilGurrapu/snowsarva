# OpenLineage â€“ The Open Standard for Data Lineage

Source: <https://openlineage.io/>, <https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage>

OpenLineage is an open-source standard for collecting and analyzing data lineage. It provides a standardized API and data model for capturing information about datasets, jobs, and job runs from various data ecosystem tools. Its goal is to create a unified view of lineage, even in complex, multi-vendor environments.

## 1. Core Concepts & Specification

OpenLineage is built around a simple, extensible JSON-based specification. The key entities are:

*   **Run**: Represents a single execution of a Job. It has a unique ID and can be in a `START`, `COMPLETE`, or `FAIL` state.
*   **Job**: Represents a process that consumes and/or produces data. It has a name and belongs to a namespace (e.g., `airflow_prod`).
*   **Dataset**: Represents a collection of data, such as a database table, a view, or a set of files in cloud storage. It has a name and a namespace (e.g., `snowflake://db.schema.my_table`).
*   **Facets**: These are the core of the specification's extensibility. A Facet is a JSON object that provides specific metadata about a Run, Job, or Dataset. Examples include:
    *   `SchemaDatasetFacet`: Describes the columns and data types of a dataset.
    *   `DataQualityMetricsInputDatasetFacet`: Attaches data quality metrics (e.g., row count, null count) to a dataset.
    *   `SqlJobFacet`: Provides the actual SQL query that was executed in a job.

### How It Works:
1.  **Instrumentation**: Data tools (e.g., Airflow, Spark, dbt) are integrated with an OpenLineage client.
2.  **Event Emission**: When a job starts, completes, or fails, the tool uses the client to emit a JSON event to a central collection endpoint (an HTTP API).
3.  **Consumption**: A lineage consumer (like Marquez, Egeria, or SnowSarva) ingests these events, parses them, and stitches them together to build and visualize a complete, cross-system lineage graph.

## 2. Architectural Implications for SnowSarva

Integrating OpenLineage is critical for making SnowSarva a comprehensive, enterprise-grade observability platform. It allows SnowSarva to look beyond the boundaries of Snowflake and understand the full end-to-end flow of data.

*   **For the `Metadata Catalog & Lineage Tracker`:**
    *   **Goal**: Position SnowSarva as a premier OpenLineage consumer.
    *   **Action**: Build a secure HTTP endpoint using a **Snowpark Container Service**. This service will act as the collection point for OpenLineage events. It should be designed to handle high-volume, concurrent requests.
    *   **Action**: Create a dedicated schema (`SNOWSARVA_APP.RAW.OPENLINEAGE_EVENTS`) with a `VARIANT` column to land the raw JSON events. A subsequent Snowpark task will parse this raw data and load it into structured lineage tables (nodes and edges).
    *   **Action**: The lineage parser must be able to process standard facets like `SchemaDatasetFacet` and `SqlJobFacet`. This will enrich the lineage graph with column-level details and the exact SQL used at each step.

*   **For the `Data Quality Assurance` Module:**
    *   **Goal**: Make SnowSarva's data quality metrics part of the open standard.
    *   **Action**: When SnowSarva's quality checks run, it should not only store the results internally but also have the *option* to emit an OpenLineage event containing a `DataQualityMetricsInputDatasetFacet`. This would allow other tools in the customer's ecosystem to see the quality scores calculated by SnowSarva.

*   **For the `Partner & Tool Integration` Strategy:**
    *   **Goal**: Dramatically accelerate integration with the modern data stack.
    *   **Action**: By supporting OpenLineage, SnowSarva automatically gains lineage integration with dozens of tools, including Airflow, Spark, Flink, and dbt. This is a powerful selling point and removes the need to build and maintain dozens of bespoke connectors.

Adopting OpenLineage transforms SnowSarva from a Snowflake-only tool into a true observability platform that can serve as the central source of truth for an entire data organization.
